Our recent work "_Math Word Problem Solving as Complex Relation Extraction_" has been accepted by [ACL-2022]([https://www.2022.aclweb.org/){:target="_blank"}.

### Motivation
Most of previous work has been focusing on tree-based generation where the root and parent nodes are usually the operators, such as "+", "-". 
We argue that these approaces are more counter-intuitive and propose a more interpretable model based on deductive reasoning. 
_Specifically, we would like to generate the mathematical expression in a step-by-step manner as shown in the figure above._

1. Tree-based model
